## Description of the Assignment
Make a team with 4 students and develop an application for the Belgian Air Force aimed at attracting more young people. The application, Wings of Belgium, should introduce users to the various careers available in the air force, beyond just becoming a pilot.

## About the Application
Wings of Belgium is a game designed to give users insight into the different skills required for various air force roles through engaging minigames.

Each minigame is associated with a specific air force role, providing players with a fun and educational experience.

Players can improve their skills and knowledge by playing these minigames and track their progress through ranks and levels. Additionally, the application features a leaderboard to foster a sense of competition and achievement among players.
